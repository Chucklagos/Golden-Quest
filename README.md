"Golden Quest" represents a significant personal milestone in my learning and development journey as a programmer. Developed as part of a class project for the Programming II course at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras, this video game was my first foray into a complex software project, where I could apply and broaden my knowledge of Java and JavaFX.

Though the game is not complete, it reflects my dedication, creativity, and ability to face and overcome technical challenges. Each line of code and every design decision in "Golden Quest" was an opportunity to learn more about object-oriented programming, problem-solving, and the importance of graphical interface and user experience in video game development.

This project is more than just an academic requirement; it is a testament to my ability to undertake and carry out complex projects, my passion for learning and improving, and my commitment to developing practical programming skills. While there is still work to be done, "Golden Quest" stands as a testament to my first significant step into the software development world and a solid starting point for more ambitious future projects. It's a project I am excited to include in my portfolio, representing not just what I have achieved, but also what I am capable of doing in the future.
